# TMUX

## Getting tmux config
My tmux config is stored here. 
It should be linked into a .tmux.config file in the home directory, like this: 
ln -s ~/Documents/git/config_files/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

## Working nice with vim

### Esc delay
There is a delay to the escape key introduced by tmux. This is fixed in the tmux config.
